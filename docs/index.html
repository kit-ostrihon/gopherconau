We wish to showcase this modern language here in beautiful Australia both as a successful tool for commercial programming and a viable career path. Part of our vision is to attract a diverse crowd both to the audience and to the stage. We aim for GopherCon Australia to reflect how we developers want the future of the industry to look.</span>

          <span class="icon-box-text">For the first year of GopherCon Australia, we will use sponsorships to attract and accommodate for international speakers and workshop hosts. By showing that GopherCon Australia is a welcoming conference, we wish to create a sense of community coming from different backgrounds, supporting traditionally underrepresented groups in the technology industry. We invited prominent contributors to the Go tech scene, who share and represent our vision of inclusion and who come from diverse gender and ethnicity groups.</span>

              <p>This workshop is for team leads, agile coaches and senior developers.</p>
              <p>The main goal is to workshop approaches to the biggest issue in software engineering; too much unverifiable code and not nearly enough human scale formal specifications.</p>
              <p>It covers topics from developer productivity to capturing system semantics. Using enterprise-ready features of Go 1.13 to advanced uses of protocol buffers.This is a hands on workshop, programming experience required, but experience with Go is not necessary.</p>
              <p>We will be using a combination of pairs and mob programming (pairs of mobs) to refactor and add features to a synthetic code base.</p>
              <p>Expect digressions into development process and economics of software engineering.</p>

        <div class="speakers-bio has-text-justified"><p>I&#39;ve been an avid Gopher since 2012 - roughly as long as I&#39;ve been living in New Zealand. I discovered such an immediate productivity boost, that I haven&#39;t looked back from Go, or NZ, since. I helped start the Go Auckland meetup group in 2013, and I&#39;ve hosted and spoken at many meetups since then.</p><p>About four years ago, a wise man persuaded me that &quot;setting up a new stack is the right time to begin CD&quot;. I claimed I was too busy getting product and platform to market, but he won me over: &quot;it&#39;s much harder to add CD later&quot;. I went with it, and I was so chuffed with the results that I&#39;ve been championing CD-related approaches ever since.</p></div>

        <div class="speakers-bio has-text-justified">Adel Smee is an Engineering Manager at Zendesk where, for the last four years, she has led innovation projects across a variety of technologies and grown a number of high performing teams. Her career in tech started with teaching people to code, before she decided to break out and get paid to do it commercially at a startup, then at Lonely Planet, and then at Zendesk. Along the way she realised that her main implicit motivator is delight in the success of others, which turns out to be a really useful quality in a manager. She is obsessed with what makes people (and herself) tick and loves to hear how she is getting it wrong so she can do better. Adel is an incurable optimist who believes that one day we’ll live in a world where everybody likes their job as much as she does, but isn’t naive enough to think that day is coming any time soon. </div>

Targeting cross platform desktop applications, as well as Mobile (Android / iOS) and more. TDD support is built in, and its written 100% in Go, so you know its good.</p><p>Fyne is a very well engineered, and exceptionally well managed project, driven by an experienced, diverse all-volunteer team distributed around the Globe.</p><p>This will be a fast paced, highly visual dive through the possibilities for application development, if you dare to throw out the rulebook and look at a fresh new approach that the Go tooling makes possible. Attendees will be challenged to let their imaginations loose, and get excited about writing "that app" that they have always wanted to finish off one day.  Now is your time !</p></p>

              <h3>Inclusiveness - It’s In Your Hands</h3>
              <p>Resilient, effective teams are diverse teams, teams that feel safe throwing around ideas, teams that look out for each other, teams where the needs of the individuals in the team are (mostly) met, teams that can learn and grow with your company. Nurturing environments in which such teams can form and flourish is an endlessly challenging and rewarding task that belongs to everyone in the company. And yet, a lot of the work to identify issues, champion change and improve a company’s culture and the diversity of its workforce is done by the same few people, or left entirely to HR. These folks could do with a hand. A hand from you! This talk will encourage you to get involved in diversity and inclusion work at your company in whatever way makes sense to you. It includes a few pointers to get you started and some stories to motivate you along the way.</p>

    title: About
    subtitle: Why Should You Come to GopherConAU?
    paragraphs:
      - text: GopherConAU believes Go is the way to go! We wish to showcase this modern language here in beautiful Australia both as a successful tool for commercial programming and a viable career path. Part of our vision is to attract a diverse crowd both to the audience and to the stage. We aim for GopherCon Australia to reflect how we developers want the future of the industry to look.
      - text: For the first year of GopherCon Australia, we will use sponsorships to attract and accommodate for international speakers and workshop hosts. By showing that GopherCon Australia is a welcoming conference, we wish to create a sense of community coming from different backgrounds, supporting traditionally underrepresented groups in the technology industry. We invited prominent contributors to the Go tech scene, who share and represent our vision of inclusion and who come from diverse gender and ethnicity groups.
      - text: Many well known Australian companies use Go, including Google, Atlassian, VMware, Seek, Siteminder, Freelancer.com, Campaign Monitor, Sajari, and many more.
      - text: GopherCon Australia is the latest in a series of conferences originating from the first GopherCon held in Denver, Colorado in 2014. The conference founders are Katie Fry and Xuanyi Chew, both organisers of the successful Sydney Go Users’ Group, and a committee of volunteers.
      - text: GopherCon Australia is happening in Sydney between 30th October and 1st November 2019. Yes, you read it right - conveniently before the weekend, so that you can extend your stay. We encourage you to take your partner, family, or friends with you, as we will provide you with recommendations on how to spend time in Sydney to enjoy the culture, art, and fun.

    title: Code of Conduct
    subtitle: Why Should You Care?
    paragraphs:
      - text: All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
      - text: Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
      - text: If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible by emailing hello@gophercon.com.au, or by speaking to a member of the conference staff. Conference staff will be wearing badges with the label 'Organiser'.

I helped start the Go Auckland meetup group in 2013, and I&#39;ve hosted and spoken at many meetups since then.</p><p>About four years ago, a wise man persuaded me that &quot;setting up a new stack is the right time to begin CD&quot;. I claimed I was too busy getting product and platform to market, but he won me over: &quot;it&#39;s much harder to add CD later&quot;. I went with it, and I was so chuffed with the results that I&#39;ve been championing CD-related approaches ever since.</p>'

      bio: 'Adel Smee is an Engineering Manager at Zendesk where, for the last four years, she has led innovation projects across a variety of technologies and grown a number of high performing teams. Her career in tech started with teaching people to code, before she decided to break out and get paid to do it commercially at a startup, then at Lonely Planet, and then at Zendesk. Along the way she realised that her main implicit motivator is delight in the success of others, which turns out to be a really useful quality in a manager. She is obsessed with what makes people (and herself) tick and loves to hear how she is getting it wrong so she can do better. Adel is an incurable optimist who believes that one day we’ll live in a world where everybody likes their job as much as she does, but isn’t naive enough to think that day is coming any time soon.

Nurturing environments in which such teams can form and flourish is an endlessly challenging and rewarding task that belongs to everyone in the company. And yet, a lot of the work to identify issues, champion change and improve a company’s culture and the diversity of its workforce is done by the same few people, or left entirely to HR. These folks could do with a hand. A hand from you! This talk will encourage you to get involved in diversity and inclusion work at your company in whatever way makes sense to you.

      #Bill's workshop
    - title: Building Production Web Services in Go
      description:
        - text: This class has been designed over the past several years and goes beyond just being a Go service class. There will be very little time spent on specifc Go syntax. Our time will be spent learning how to re-engineer a web service and talk about application design, semantics and guidelines for building services in Go.
        - text: Building Production Web Services In Go
        - text: • Start/Stop
        - text: • Logging/Configuration
        - text: • Web Framework Design
        - text: • Database Support

      outcomes:
        - item: Everyone is going to be mentally exhausted by the end of the day. We will be challenging every student to think about what they are doing and why. In the 4 years we have taught this material, we never had someone not appreciate the class and feel like they are a better developer for it. If you want to be a better Go developer, code reviewer, designer and architect, this is the class you want to take.

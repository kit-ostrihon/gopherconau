    subtitle: Why Should You Come to GopherConAU?
    paragraphs:
      - text: GopherConAU believes Go is the way to go! We wish to showcase this modern language here in beautiful Australia both as a successful tool for commercial programming and a viable career path. Part of our vision is to attract a diverse crowd both to the audience and to the stage. We aim for GopherCon Australia to reflect how we developers want the future of the industry to look.
      - text: For the first year of GopherCon Australia, we will use sponsorships to attract and accommodate for international speakers and workshop hosts. By showing that GopherCon Australia is a welcoming conference, we wish to create a sense of community coming from different backgrounds, supporting traditionally underrepresented groups in the technology industry. We invited prominent contributors to the Go tech scene, who share and represent our vision of inclusion and who come from diverse gender and ethnicity groups.
      - text: Many well known Australian companies use Go, including Google, Atlassian, VMware, Seek, Siteminder, Freelancer.com, Campaign Monitor, Sajari, and many more.
      - text: GopherCon Australia is the latest in a series of conferences originating from the first GopherCon held in Denver, Colorado in 2014. The conference founders are Katie Fry and Xuanyi Chew, both organisers of the successful Sydney Go Users’ Group, and a committee of volunteers.
      - text: GopherCon Australia is happening in Sydney between 30th October and 1st November 2019. Yes, you read it right - conveniently before the weekend, so that you can extend your stay. We encourage you to take your partner, family, or friends with you, as we will provide you with recommendations on how to spend time in Sydney to enjoy the culture, art, and fun.

    title: Code of Conduct
    subtitle: Why Should You Care?
    paragraphs:
      - text: All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
      - text: Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.
      - text: If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible by emailing hello@gophercon.com.au, or by speaking to a member of the conference staff. Conference staff will be wearing badges with the label 'Organiser'.

I claimed I was too busy getting product and platform to market, but he won me over: &quot;it&#39;s much harder to add CD later&quot;.

        description: '<p>Building an API with the net/http library is incredibly easy…until it isn’t. Even in 2019 the advice you find online when doing routing is often to “use X framework” or “just use net/http” without a lot of context for how to use them well. In this talk I will cover request parsing, writing middleware, using context, and other useful skills to level up your standard library-only APIs.</p>'

      #Bill's workshop
    - title: Building Production Web Services in Go
      description:
        - text: This class has been designed over the past several years and goes beyond just being a Go service class. There will be very little time spent on specifc Go syntax. Our time will be spent learning how to re-engineer a web service and talk about application design, semantics and guidelines for building services in Go.
        - text: Building Production Web Services In Go
        - text: • Start/Stop
        - text: • Logging/Configuration
        - text: • Web Framework Design
        - text: • Database Support
        - text: • Testing
        - text: • Metrics/Tracing
        - text: • Modules/Docker/Compose
      prerequisites:
        - item: A basic understanding of the Go programming language. Students do not have to be expert Go users but they will get the most from the workshop if they have completed the majority of the Go Tour.
      outcomes:
        - item: Everyone is going to be mentally exhausted by the end of the day. We will be challenging every student to think about what they are doing and why. In the 4 years we have taught this material, we never had someone not appreciate the class and feel like they are a better developer for it. If you want to be a better Go developer, code reviewer, designer and architect, this is the class you want to take.

        - text: We will be using a combination of pairs and mob programming (pairs of mobs) to refactor and add features to a synthetic code base.
        - text: Expect digressions into development process and economics of software engineering.
      prerequisites:
        - item: A basic understanding of microservices architectures
      outcomes:
